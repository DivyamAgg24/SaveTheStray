# Road Safety from Animal Collision

## Overview
We propose two solutions to prevent animal-vehicle collisions:
1. A vehicle-integrated device that detects animals on the road and emits specific frequencies to deter them.
2. Roadside alarming signs equipped with detection capabilities to warn drivers of animal presence in real time.
The system leverages artificial intelligence, object detection models, and programmable frequency generators to enhance road safety while ensuring animal welfare.

## Features

### Animal Detection
1. Real Time animal detection using models like YoloV9
2. Classification of animals and localisation

### Frequency Generation
1. Generation of frequency to deter animals from road
2. Keeping in mind the hearing range of humans and not producing frequencies that are harmful to humans
3. Custom frequency ranges tailored for different species.

### Roadside Warning Signs
1. Detection of animals using devices deployed at road signs
2. LED or LCD displays alert drivers to animals ahead.
3. Servo-controlled speakers direct sound frequencies toward animals to guide them away.
